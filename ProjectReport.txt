Introduction:
Heart disease is a major health concern worldwide, and early detection and prevention are crucial in reducing the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events.
Machine learning models can be used to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various risk factors.
In this project, we aim to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict heart disease in patients based on their demographic and clinical characteristics.

Data Cleaning and Encoding:
The first step in our project was to clean and encode the data.
We checked for missing values and replaced them with appropriate values.
We also mapped the Gender column and replaced each Male with 0 and females with 1 so the model can read that data.
We also encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding and label encoding techniques.
We encoded the work_type column using the OneHotEncoder to transform the work_type into 5 columns and dropped the work_column.
We encoded the smoking_status using ordered number from 0 to 2 indicating the severity where 0 = never smokes and 2 = smokes.
All the datatypes were also corrected and changed to int except the st_depression as it accepts floating values.
We also removed any outliers in the data using the interquartile range method after using the box_plot to map the outliers.

Data visualization: 
Data visualization is an important step in any machine learning project as it helps to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and the target variable.
In this project, we used various visualization techniques to visualize the data and identify the most important features for predicting heart disease.
One of the most important relationships we found was between age and heart disease. 
We plotted the distribution of age for each target class and found that the risk of heart disease increased with age.
This is consistent with previous research that has shown that age is a major risk factor for heart disease.
We also found a relationship between gender and heart disease.
We plotted the distribution of gender for each target class and found that females were more likely to have heart disease than males.
We also found a relationship between exercise-induced angina and chest pain type.
We plotted the distribution of chest pain type for each target class and found that patients without excercise-angina were more likely to have chest pain than patients with excercise-angina.
we found a relationship between thallium type and heart disease.
We found that people with thallium = 7(with defects) are more likely to have a heart disease than other thallium types
This is consistent with previous research that has shown that reversible defects(thallium = 7) are a major indicator of heart disease.
There was a relation between chest pain type and heart disease,as it shows that people with chest pain type are more likely to have a heart disease.
Another relation was found between chest pain type and gender.
Females were more likely to have a chest pain than males.
data visualization helped us to identify important relationships between different variables and the target variable. 
These relationships can be used to develop more accurate machine learning models for predicting heart disease.

Feature Selection:
We used mutual information gain to select the most important features for predicting heart disease.
We then used the SelectKBest function to select the top 12 features for our models.

Model Building and Evaluation:
We built several machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, and SVM.
We used grid search to find the best hyperparameters for the random forest model.
We evaluated the models using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and mean squared error.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, our project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting heart disease in patients based on their demographic and clinical characteristics. 
Our models achieved good accuracy in predicting heart disease, with the random forest model achieving the highest accuracy of 80%.
The confusion matrix and classification report showed that our models had good precision and recall for both positive and negative cases.
The mean squared error was also low, indicating that our models were able to predict heart disease with good accuracy.
Further research can be done to improve the accuracy of the models and to identify additional risk factors for heart disease.
